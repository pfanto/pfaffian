This Supplemental Material repository contains the codes and data files necessary 
to carry out the particle-number projection in the single j-shell model described
in the main text.

The directory pfproj/ contains the Python codes and data files required to make all the figures
shown in the article.  Its subdirectories are:

scripts/: This directory contains the Python codes to use the Pfaffian formula. 
This directory also includes a Python code to do the projection explicitly in the
many-particle space.

plots/: This directory contains a Python code to plot the results of the Pfaffian
formula against those of the explicit projection.

proof.pdf contains the proof of the results in Eqs. (4) and (5) of the main text.

Direct any questions to paul.fanto@yale.edu.
